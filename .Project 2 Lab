# Lab 02 â€“ Practice Using User Input with Variables in Python

# Prompt the user for their favorite number and convert it to an integer
favNum = int(input("Please enter your favorite number: "))

# Prompt the user for their age and convert it to an integer
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Prompt the user for their name (no conversion needed since it's a string)
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Display the user's information using f-string formatting
print(f"{name}, your favorite number is {favNum} and you are {age} years old.")
